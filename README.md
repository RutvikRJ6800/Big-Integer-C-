# üí° What is Big Integer Library?

Big Integer Library contains fuctions related to various arithmatic operations like
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, gcd, factorial, exponent on large numbers that doesn't fit into int or long long int data type.
    <br /> 
Read more on all tools you can readily use in the [integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) section. Can't find your tool? You can always [write your own integration](https://docs.zenml.io/advanced-guide/stacks/custom-flavors) to use it with ZenML.

# ü§∏ Getting Started

## üíæ How to use .?
Include bigInt.h Header file into your c++ file using below code:

```cpp
#include "bigInt.h"
```
> **Note** - Big Integer Library supports C++11, C++14, and C++17.

## üèá Below are the examples of functions.

If you're you want to add two large numbers:

```cpp
string num1 = "16546313156645";
string num2 = "48798451351";
string result = add(num1, num2);
cout<<result<<endl;
```

If you're you want to subtract two large numbers:

```cpp
string num1 = "232688975318412";
string num2 = "116445186451";
string result = sub(num1, num2);
cout<<result<<endl;
```

If you're you want to multiply two large numbers:

```cpp
string num1 = "12168412158";
string num2 = "86746564554988";
string result = multiplication(num1, num2);
cout<<result<<endl;
```

If you're you want to divide two large numbers:

```cpp
string num1 = "15464841654645598";
string num2 = "787665431513216";
string result = division(num1, num2);
cout<<result<<endl;
```

If you're you want to find factorial of large number:

```cpp
string num = "9875114";
string result = factorial(num);
cout<<result<<endl;
```

If you're you want to find gcd of two large numbers:

```cpp
string num1 = "15464841654645598";
string num2 = "787665431513216";
string result = gcd(num1, num2);
cout<<result<<endl;
```

If you're you want to find modulo of two large numbers:

```cpp
string num1 = "15464841654645598";
string num2 = "787665431513216";
string result = modulo(num1, num2);
cout<<result<<endl;
```

If you're you want to find exponent of two large numbers:

```cpp
string num1 = "15464841654645598";
string num2 = "787665431513216";
string result = exponent(num1, num2);
cout<<result<<endl;
```

If you're you want to find exponent of two large numbers:

```cpp
string num1 = "15464841654645598";
string num2 = "787665431513216";
string result = exponent(num1, num2);
cout<<result<<endl;
```



This spins up a Jupyter notebook that walks you through various functionalities of ZenML at a high level.

By the end, you'll get a glimpse of how to use ZenML to register a stack:

```shell
# Register a MLflow experiment tracker
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow

# Register an Airflow orchestrator
zenml airflow register airflow_orchestrator --flavor=airflow

# Create a stack from the components
zenml stack register my_stack -o airflow_orchestrator -a default -e mlflow_tracker
```

And run a simple pipeline on Airflow (or an orchestrator of your choice) creating steps like this:

```python
import mlflow
from sklearn.base import ClassifierMixin
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from zenml.client import Client

experiment_tracker = Client().active_stack.experiment_tracker

@step(experiment_tracker=experiment_tracker.name)
def svc_trainer_mlflow(
    X_train: pd.DataFrame,
    y_train: pd.Series,
) -> ClassifierMixin:
    """Train a sklearn SVC classifier and log to MLflow."""
    mlflow.sklearn.autolog()  # log all model hparams and metrics to MLflow
    model = SVC(gamma=0.01)
    model.fit(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy())
    train_acc = model.score(X_train.to_numpy(), y_train.to_numpy())
    print(f"Train accuracy: {train_acc}")
    return model
```

You can also run your first pipeline right in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/quickstart/notebooks/quickstart.ipynb)

## üë≠ Collaborate with ZenML

ZenML is built to support teams working together. 
The underlying infrastructure on which your ML workflows run can be shared, as can the data, assets, and artifacts in your workflow. 

To visually see this in action, ZenML ships with a fully-featured dashboard, that can be launched locally with the simple command:

```
zenml up
```

![ZenML Dashboard](docs/book/assets/getting_started/zenml-up.gif)

The dashboard can also be deployed with a server on any cloud service (see Deploy ZenML section).


## üç∞ ZenBytes

New to MLOps? Get up to speed by visiting the [ZenBytes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes) repo.

>ZenBytes is a series of short practical MLOps lessons taught using ZenML. 
>It covers many of the [core concepts](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts) widely used in ZenML and MLOps in general.

## üìú ZenFiles

Already comfortable with ZenML and wish to elevate your pipeline into production mode? Check out [ZenFiles](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenfiles).

>ZenFiles is a collection of production-grade ML use-cases powered by ZenML. They are fully fleshed out, end-to-end projects that showcase ZenML's capabilities. They can also serve as a template from which to start similar projects.


# ‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure Requirements

## üîã Deploy ZenML

While ZenML works perfectly fine locally, it should be deployed on the cloud to enable collaborative features as the central MLOps interface for teams.

The easiest and fastest way to get running on the cloud is by using the `deploy` CLI command. It currently only supports deploying to Kubernetes on managed cloud services. Read more about the command [here](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml).

```shell
zenml deploy
```

Naturally, [the docs](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml) contain detailed guides on how to manually set up ZenML on the cloud in case more control is required.

The following architectural diagram illustrates a common ZenML deployment:

![ZenML Architecture Diagram.](docs/book/assets/getting_started/Scenario3.2.png)

## üë®‚Äçüç≥ Open Source MLOps Stack Recipes

Apart from the infrastructure required to run ZenML itself, ZenML also boasts a ton of [integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) into popular MLOps tools. The [ZenML Stack](https://docs.zenml.io/starter-guide/stacks/stacks) concept ensures that these tools work nicely together, therefore bringing structure and standardization into the MLOps workflow.

However, ZenML assumes that the stack infrastructure for these tools is already provisioned. If you do not have deployed infrastructure, and want to quickly spin up combinations of tools on the cloud, the [MLOps stack sister repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlops-stacks) contains a series of Terraform-based recipes to provision such stacks. These recipes can be used directly with ZenML:

```bash
pip install "zenml[stacks]"

zenml stack recipe deploy <NAME_OF_STACK_RECIPE> --import
```

The above command not only provisions the given tools, but also automatically creates a ZenML stack with the configuration of the deployed recipe!


# üó∫ Roadmap

ZenML is being built in public. The [roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) is a
regularly updated source of truth for the ZenML community to understand where
the product is going in the short, medium, and long term.

ZenML is managed by a [core team](https://zenml.io/company#CompanyTeam) of developers that are
responsible for making key decisions and incorporating feedback from the
community. The team oversees feedback via various channels, and you can directly
influence the roadmap as follows:

- Vote on your most wanted feature on our [Discussion
  board](https://zenml.io/discussion).
- Start a thread in our [Slack channel](https://zenml.io/slack-invite).
- [Create an issue](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/issues/new/choose) on our Github repo.
